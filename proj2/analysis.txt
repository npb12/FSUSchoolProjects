The following code is my reverse function:

1     struct node *temp = NULL;  
2     struct node *current = head_ref;
3      
4     
5      
6     while (current !=  NULL)
7     {
8        temp = current->prev;
9        current->prev = current->next;
10       current->next = temp;              
11       current = current->prev;
12    }      
13      
14     if(temp != NULL )
15        head_ref = temp->prev;

Lines 1 and 2 account for one unit each  (2)
line 6 accounts for N+1 for all tests    (N+1)
lines 8-11 account for 1 and executed N times (4N)
line 14 and 15 also account for 1 apiece (2) 


results in total of 5N+5
resulting in O(N)
